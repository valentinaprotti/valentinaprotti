### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Valentina and I'm a Data Science master graduate from University of Bologna, Italy.

I'm currently working on AI applications on IDP (Intelligent Document Processing), with an eye open on new market trends.

I'm open for challenges and always looking for occasions to learn something new!
